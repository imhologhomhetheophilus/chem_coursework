    <h2>About the Department</h2>
    <p>
      The Department of Chemical Engineering Technology, Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa, was established in November 2001 following the resolution of the then Governing Council to set up the department in the Polytechnic with emphasis on Solid Minerals Research and Development. This aligns with the goal of the Federal Government to revive the nation’s ailing economy by developing the solid minerals sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sector was rightly identified by the then Rector of the Polytechnic, <strong>Dr. I.M. Bugaje</strong>, as being capable of replacing petroleum — the major foreign exchange earner for the country. Recognizing the abundant deposits of solid minerals in Nasarawa State, “Home of Solid Minerals,” the Governing Council approved the establishment of the Department of Chemical Engineering Technology to train skilled manpower for the solid minerals industry.

    <h2>Nature of Chemical Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      Chemical Engineering is a branch of engineering that combines principles of <strong>mechanical engineering</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong> to transform raw materials into useful end products through physical and chemical processes. It involves processing minerals, refining crude oil, and converting agricultural materials into industrial products.
    </p>

    <h2>Department Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To produce technical personnel capable of carrying out and supervising chemical processes in industries, especially in the downstream sector of solid minerals.</li>
      <li>To conduct research into identified solid minerals and develop or adapt appropriate processing technologies for transforming them into quality raw materials or end products.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p data-aos="fade-left">
    In line with its founding mandate, the Department has collaborated with organizations such as <strong>ETF, RMRDC, STEP-B Project, UNIDO,</strong> and the <strong>Japanese Embassy</strong> to advance research and consultancy in solid minerals processing.
