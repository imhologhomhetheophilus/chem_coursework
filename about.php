      <h2>About the Department</h2>
      <p>
        The Department of Chemical Engineering Technology, Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa, was established in November 2001 following the resolution of the then Governing Council to set up the department with emphasis on Solid Minerals Research and Development. This aligns with the goal of the Federal Government to revive the nation’s economy by developing the solid minerals sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        This initiative was championed by the Rector, <strong>Dr. I.M. Bugaje</strong>, who identified the solid minerals industry as capable of replacing petroleum as the major foreign exchange earner for Nigeria. Given the abundance of solid minerals in Nasarawa State — “Home of Solid Minerals” — the department was established to train skilled manpower for the solid minerals industry.

      <h2>Nature of Chemical Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Chemical Engineering is a branch of engineering that combines principles of <strong>mechanical engineering</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong> to transform raw materials into useful end products through physical and chemical processes. It involves processing minerals, refining crude oil, and converting agricultural materials into industrial products.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>Department Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
