    <h2>About the Department</h2>
    <p>
      The Department of Chemical Engineering Technology, Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa, was established in November 2001 following the resolution of the Governing Council to set up the department with emphasis on Solid Minerals Research and Development. This aligns with the goal of the Federal Government to revive the nation’s economy by developing the solid minerals sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      The department’s creation was championed by the then Rector, <strong>Dr. I.M. Bugaje</strong>, who recognized the potential of the solid minerals industry to replace petroleum as Nigeria’s main foreign exchange earner. Given the rich solid mineral deposits in Nasarawa State — the “Home of Solid Minerals” — the department was established to train skilled manpower for this vital industry.
