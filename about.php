    The Department of Chemical Engineering Technology, Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa, was established in November, 2001 following the resolution of the then Governing Council to set up the department in the Polytechnic with emphasis on Solid Minerals Research and Development. This is in line with the goal of the Federal Government to revive the nation’s ailing economy by developing the solid minerals sector. This sector was rightly identified by the then Rector of the Polytechnic, in person of, Dr. I.M. Bugaje; as being capable of replacing petroleum, the major foreign exchange earner for the country. The then Rector convinced the then Governing Council to identify herself with this goal of Federal Government due to the abundant deposits of solid minerals in Nasarawa State “Home of Solid Minerals” and its environs. The Council also realized that the goal could not be fully achieved without a well-trained low level manpower to man the downstream sector of the solid mineral industry. Thus the council approved to setup the Department of Chemical Engineering Technology, in The Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa.
Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering professions that emanates from Mechanical Engineering and Chemistry; it is concerned with physical and chemical processes that transform raw materials, either mined or grown, into useful end products with economic considerations. It comprises the processing of various minerals resources into useful industrial raw materials or end products, such as, the refining of crude oil into petroleum products, and processing of agricultural products, amongst many others. This programme was established in The Federal Polytechnic. Nasarawa with the following objectives; 
<ol type="1" class=" mb-5 text-lg-starts text-md-start p-5 " style="margin-top:-5rem">
<li class="lead "><em>To produce technical personnel capable of carrying out and supervising chemical processes in process industries especially downstream sector of the solid mineral industries.</em></li>
<li class="lead "><em>To carry out research in identified solid minerals with a view to identify design and/or adapt appropriate processing technology for their transformation into quality raw materials or end products.</em></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="lead p-3 text-lg-starts text-md-start  fs-4 pb-md-5 " style="margin-top:-5rem; margin-bottom:5rem">In line with the mandate given by the Governing Council at the inception of the programme, the Department has identified herself and collaborated with the following: ETF, RMRDC, STEP B Project, Nasarawa and Ebonyi States, in pushing the frontiers of Indigenous Technology through Researches and Consultancy in Solid Minerals Processing. The funding for some of the projects were received from ETF, STEP B Project, State Governments, UNIDO and Japanese Embassy.</h4>
